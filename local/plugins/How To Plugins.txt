How To Plugins
--------------

LOCAL PLUGINS

Some times it's appropriate to have some plugins here, in /local/RealTimeMonitoringService/enabled
These plugins run first in priority

These are great, they don't require anything fancy. You can build quick and dirty PHP scripts that run with high efficiency. 
Have a look at the examples.

Simply move from disabled to enabled, and run the local plugin from your browser to see the result.


PLUGIN HOOKS

Inside your plugin, create a folder called RTMS (RealTimeMonitoringService), and place your PHP script there. It makes no difference where your code
lives, in /local, or in /blocks/myCustomPlugin/RTMS

But, placing it inside your existing plugin can allow you to retain private code repositories much more efficiently.

Both options are provided to maximize useage of the RTMS system.
